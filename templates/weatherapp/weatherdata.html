                <h2>Temperature - "{{temperature}}"</h2>
                <p>Definition: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance or system. In weather contexts, it refers to the degree of hotness or coldness of the atmosphere. <br><br>

                    Measurement Units: Temperature is commonly measured in Celsius (째C), Fahrenheit (째F), or Kelvin (K) scales. Celsius and Fahrenheit are most widely used for weather reporting. <br>
                    
                    Variability: Temperature can vary throughout the day, between different locations, and across seasons due to factors such as solar radiation, atmospheric conditions, and geographical features.

                <h2>Humidity - "{{humidity}}"</h2>
                <p>Definition: Humidity denotes the presence of water vapor in the air, typically unseen by the naked eye. <br><br>

                    Indicators: Humidity signals potential rain, dew formation, or foggy conditions. <br>
                    
                    Influence Factors: Humidity is influenced by both atmospheric pressure and temperature. <br>
                    
                    Temperature Impact: In colder air, the same amount of water vapor can lead to higher relative humidity compared to warmer air. <br>

                <h2>Wind Speed - "{{windSpeed}}"</h2>
                <p>Definition: Wind speed refers to the rate at which air moves horizontally past a fixed point. <br><br>

                    Measurement Units: Wind speed is commonly measured in units such as meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), miles per hour (mph), or knots (nautical miles per hour). <br>
                    
                    Instruments: Anemometers are commonly used instruments to measure. They come in various designs, including cup, propeller, and sonic anemometers.

                <h2>Rain - "{{rain}}"</h2>
                <p> Definition: Rain is precipitation in the form of liquid water droplets that fall from clouds and reach the ground. <br><br>

                    Formation: Rain occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into droplets, which then become heavy enough to fall due to gravity. <br>
                    
                    Types: Rainfall can vary in intensity and duration, ranging from light drizzle to heavy downpour, and can be categorized as steady, intermittent, or showery.

                <h2>Snow - "{{snow}}"</h2>
                <p>Formation: Snow forms when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses directly into ice crystals without passing through the liquid phase. These crystals then combine to form snowflakes. <br><br>

                    Conditions: Snow typically occurs when temperatures are below freezing (0째C or 32째F) in the atmosphere and at the surface. However, factors like humidity and atmospheric pressure also influence snow formation. <br>
                    
                    Types: Snowfall can vary in intensity, ranging from light flurries to heavy snowstorms. It can also be categorized based on snowflake size and shape, such as powdery, granular, or wet snow.

                <h2>Atmospheric Pressure - "{{atmosphericPressure}}"</h2>
                <p>Definition: Atmospheric pressure, also known as air pressure, is the force exerted by the weight of the atmosphere on the Earth's surface and objects within it. <br><br>

                    Measurement Units: Atmospheric pressure is commonly measured in units such as millibars (mb), kilopascals (kPa), inches of mercury (inHg), or pounds per square inch (psi). <br>
                    
                    Variability: Atmospheric pressure varies with altitude, temperature, and weather conditions. It typically decreases with increasing altitude due to the decreasing density of air molecules.
